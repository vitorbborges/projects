## About

I am a 21 years data scientist studying Economics at the [Economics Department](http://www.economia.unb.br/) of the University of Bras√≠lia, and at the same time study [Statistics](http://est.unb.br/) with the intention of acquiring it as a second diploma. On the side I am a independent research assistant in many Data-Oriented projects at different facilities. I build some interesting research projects and experiment with trending Artificial Intelligence content.

In my free time i like to study Mathematics, History and solve the Rubik's Cube (current single-solve record: 15.06s). Some individual research interest are Time Series Models, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. I also like to study languages (currently learning German).
